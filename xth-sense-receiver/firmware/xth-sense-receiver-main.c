/*	
	Quick overview of the receiving serial code: We basically have a single-byte receiving buffer going on behind the scenes (it's titled 
	"byte_From_UART", and it's defined in xth-sense-receiver-uart.h)
	
	We automatically fill this byte using the ISR(USART_RX_vect) handler, which is called every time that the UART has successfully
	received a byte. 
	
	In main(), we use read_byte() to pull the value out of "byte_From_UART", and send it directly out through our PWM analog output by 
	assigning it to the output comparison value of timer0.
*/


/* A way that we watched for packet timeouts:

	Have a timeout counter (timer1) running in the background all of the time. The timeout counter will be reset 
	every time that a UART packet is received (see UART interrupt handler routine). If the timeout counter 
	reaches its max value (determined by packet timeout duration), then do whatever (turn on LED to show, 
	later on implement some algorithm to replace this value with a linear interpolation)

	Recall that we interrupt on every UART-received byte. Inside interrupt: reset the timeout counter to zero
	
	Please note that we have some version of this code written out in xth-sense-receiver-uart.c, but its timing probably
	doesn't match the sample/transmit rates that we're using now
