/*	Overview:
	1)	ADC readings via interrupt at approximately 4.6 kHz sample rate
	2)	In each ADC interrupt, update the value stored in the global variable adc_val
	3)	Meanwhile, timer2 interrupts at roughly 960 Hz (same as in wireless Receiver)
		On timer2 interrupt: pass out current value adc_val to the serial port...
